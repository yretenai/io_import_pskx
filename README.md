ActorX PSK/PSA importer for Blender 3.0+

## Installation

- Download the repository (`Code -> Download ZIP` in the top right)
- Open Blender
- Navigate through Edit -> Preferences -> Addons
- Click "Install..."
- Navigate to where the repository is downloaded
- Install the zip/folder

Alternatively copy the repository directory into your Blender Addons folder:

- `%APPDATA%/Blender Foundation/Blender/3.0/scripts/addons` on Windows
- `~/.config/blender/3.0/scripts/addons` on Linux-based systems
- `~/Library/Application Support/Blender/3.0/scripts/addons` on macOS

The folder may not exist, if so you should create it. The `3.0` may be a different number. 

- In the Addons Preferences window again, click refresh if you manually copied the folder.
- Search `Import ActorX`, click the checkbox to the left of the name.

## Usage

To import a PSK or PSA file, use the appropriate importer from `File -> Import -> ActorX ...`
